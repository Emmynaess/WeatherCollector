# Weather Collector
A Python-based project to fetch weather forecasts from SMHI, save the data in an Excel file, and display forecasts in the terminal.

## Features
Fetch weather data from SMHI’s API.
Save weather data to an Excel file.
Display a weather forecast in the terminal with clear headings and colors.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install and run the project.

1. Clone or Download the Project
bash

```git clone https://github.com/Emmynaess/WeatherCollector.git```

cd weather-collector

3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
 
```python -m venv venv```

Activate by:

```source venv/bin/activate```

or

```venv\Scripts\activate```

5. Install Required Packages
Install the necessary Python packages by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Required Packages:
requests: For making HTTP calls to SMHI’s API.

openpyxl: For creating and managing Excel files.

### Usage
Run the Program
Use the following command to run the program:

python main.py

### Menu Options
After starting the program, you’ll see the following options in the terminal:


MENU

1. Fetch latest data
   
2. Print forecast
   
9. Exit

Fetch Latest Data

Retrieves data from SMHI’s API and saves it in a file named 'Väderdata.xlsx.'

Print Forecast

Displays the latest 24-hour weather forecast in the terminal. The headers are color-coded in blue for better readability.

Exit
Closes the program.

### Requirements
Python 3.8 or later
Packages listed in requirements.txt (install using pip)


### Error Handling
Common Issues

- File Väderdata.xlsx Not Found: If you try to print a forecast without first fetching data, the program will show this message:
"You need to fetch data first by selecting option 1 from the menu."

- Colors Not Displayed in the Terminal: If the text color doesn’t display as expected: Ensure your terminal supports ANSI colors (most modern terminals do).

- If you’re using a Windows terminal, PowerShell typically supports ANSI colors.

### Future Improvements
Add more API calls to include additional weather parameters, such as:

Wind speed

Humidity

Air pressure

Include graphical representations of weather forecasts in the Excel file.

Add an option to choose different coordinates directly from the menu.
